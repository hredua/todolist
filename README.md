# Welcome To do List

## How to use: 

Add tasks with enter or click button

Delete tasks from the delete button

Check completed tasks in the checkbox

### Stats for nerds: 

Tasks are stored locally

Since there is no CSS when checking the checkbox and inspecting the element, you can see that its state changes from false to true

If you want to see the application code and not deploy it, switch to the "branch master"

# Enjoy :)
